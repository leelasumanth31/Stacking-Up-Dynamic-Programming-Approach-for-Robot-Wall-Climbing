Solving the Robot Stacking Problem using Dynamic Programming
1. Introduction
This report presents an analysis of the dynamic programming approach applied to solve the Robot Stacking Problem. The aim was to develop a solution that efficiently distributes robots into stacks, considering various constraints.

2. Recurrence Relation
To address the problem, a recurrence relation was formulated. It iterates over potential stack sizes, accumulating the number of ways robots can be distributed. This recursive approach facilitates breaking down the problem into smaller, more manageable subproblems.

3. Base Cases
Critical base cases were identified to govern the termination conditions of the recursion. These cases ensure that the algorithm halts appropriately, preventing infinite recursion. Specifically, they handle scenarios where a valid distribution is achieved or when further recursion is unnecessary.

4. Time and Space Complexities (Recursive Approach)
The time complexity of the recursive approach is O(k×b×n), where k, b, and n represent the maximum stack size, total number of robots, and total number of stacks, respectively. Similarly, the space complexity is O(k×n), reflecting the size of the dynamic programming matrix.

5. Iterative Approach Pseudocode
An alternative iterative approach was outlined to solve the problem. This approach initializes a dynamic programming matrix and iteratively updates its values based on the recurrence relation. By avoiding recursive function calls, this method offers improved efficiency.

6. Time and Space Complexities (Iterative Approach)
The time and space complexities of the iterative approach remain the same as the recursive approach: O(k×b×n) and O(k×n), respectively. However, the iterative approach may exhibit better performance due to reduced overhead from function calls.

7. Conclusion
In conclusion, the dynamic programming approach presented in this report offers an effective solution to the Robot Stacking Problem. By leveraging recurrence relations and efficient memory management, the algorithm achieves optimal distribution of robots into stacks.
