# Stacking-Up-Dynamic-Programming-Approach-for-Robot-Wall-Climbing
 This project devises a dynamic programming solution for the Robot Stacking Problem. It formulates recurrence relations, handles base cases, and proposes a recursive approach. Time and space complexities are analyzed. Overall, it efficiently allocates robots into stacks, ensuring optimal distribution.
